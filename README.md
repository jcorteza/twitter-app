## Steps To Get Up and Running
### Set Up App Configuration
* Create a Twitter account, if you don't have one already, by visiting the [Twitter Sign Up page](https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup) and filling out the form.
* Log in to Twitter.
* Visit the [Twitter Developers page](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en.html). In the dropdown menu under your Twitter handle select [Apps](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps).
* On the new page that loads, click on the blue [Create an app](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps/create) button and fill out the necessary details to receive your API keys.
* Once your app has been set up, go back to the [Apps page](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps) and click on the Details button of your new application.
* Click on the Permissions tab on the new page that loads. Click the blue Edit button, and make sure your Access permission is set to "Read and write."
* Now select the "Keys and tokens" tab of your application. Copy the Consumer API keys and access tokens into a new file "twitter4j.properties," which should be located in the same directory as the cloned git repo.
* The format of your "twitter4j.properties" file should follow the format shown in the [twitter4J Configuration documentation](http://twitter4j.org/en/configuration.html) as shown below:

### Setting Up Maven Project
* [Install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) if it's not already installed on your computer.
* Initialize your Maven project by following the [Creating a Project Maven insructions](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html). Make sure the groupId is com.khoros.twitterapp and the artifactId is TwitterApp.
* Copy your twitter4j.properties file into a new 'resources' directory in the TwiterApp/src/main directory.
### Setting up Dropwizard
* Add a file 'configuration.yml' to your root directory and add the following text to the file and save it:
  ```
  server:
    type: simple
    applicationContextPath: /api/1.0/twitter/
    connector:
      type: http
      port: 8080
  ```
* Make sure you have an updated pom.xml file that includes dropwizard as a dependency. You can use [Dropwizard's Tutorial](https://www.dropwizard.io/1.3.9/docs/getting-started.html#tutorial) to get maven set up with Dropwizard.
* Once your pom.xml file is updated, you can reimport your project with Maven in IntelliJ.
  * Right click on your pom.xml file in IntelliJ.
  * Hover over "Maven" until the submenu opens.
  * Click on reimport.
  * Give your library a couple of minutes to update.
* Dropwizard should now be integrated into your Maven project.
### Compile, Package, and Run
* Compile and package your Maven project by running the following command in the command line: `mvn package`
* There should now be a new 'target' directory with two JAR files in it.
* To run your fat-JAR file and start the Dropwizard server use the following command:
  ```
  java -jar target/TwitterApp-1.0-SNAPSHOT-launcher.jar server configuration.yml
  ```
  * [Dropwizard Referenceâ€”Runing Your Application](https://www.dropwizard.io/1.3.9/docs/getting-started.html#running-your-application)
* Your server should now be listening to client requests.
#### Making Client Requests
* You can use `curl` to make a POST request to [http://localhost:8080/api/1.0/twitter/tweet](http://localhost:8080/api/1.0/twitter/tweet) as such:
  ```
  curl -X POST --data-urlencode message="<your message>" http://localhost:8080/api/1.0/twitter/tweet
  ```
* To make GET request to [http://localhost:8080/api/1.0/twitter/timeline](http://localhost:8080/api/1.0/twitter/timeline) you can use curl or the browser:
  * Using curl:
    ```
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/1.0/twitter/timeline
    ```
  * Using the browser: Open [http://localhost:8080/api/1.0/twitter/timeline](http://localhost:8080/api/1.0/twitter/timeline) in the browser of your choice.
## Testing the Application
